# This is about the for loop

# Example of for loop with list
animals = ['Dog', 'Cat', 'Bear', 'Snail', 'Turtle', 'Lion']

for animal in animals:
    print animal
# Like an enumerator - for x in a list, do something with x

# Example with a string
word = raw_input("Enter something: ")

for letter in word:
    print "Gimme a " + letter + "!"
    print letter + "!"

print "What does that spell?"
print word + "!"
